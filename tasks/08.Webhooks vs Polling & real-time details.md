# 8 â€” Webhooks vs Polling & real-time details

Gmail:

- Best: Gmail push notifications using watch -> Pub/Sub -> your backend. Pros: immediate. Cons: more setup (Pub/Sub with permissions).
- Fallback: poll periodically using messages.list with q parameter and labelIds to restrict.

Calendar:

- Calendar push notifications available, or poll.

HubSpot:

- HubSpot has webhooks for contact creation/engagements; configure webhook URL in your HubSpot app.

**Recommendation**: Use webhooks for HubSpot and Calendar where possible; for Gmail use Pub/Sub push if you can manage GCP settings, otherwise polling.
