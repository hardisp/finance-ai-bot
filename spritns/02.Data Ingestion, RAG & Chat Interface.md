# 🧠 Sprint 2 — Data Ingestion, RAG & Chat Interface

**Duration**: 2 weeks
**Goal**: Import Gmail + HubSpot data, embed it into pgvector, and answer questions via RAG chat.

## ✅ Deliverables

- Gmail importer (polling for now; Pub/Sub optional)
- HubSpot importer for contacts and notes
- Embedding service (OpenAI or local model)
- Store chunks + embeddings in Postgres documents + vectors
- Chat UI (ChatGPT-like interface)
- Backend endpoint /api/chat → retrieves context via pgvector and uses LLM to answer

## 🔧 Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] User can ask: “Who mentioned their kid plays baseball?” — agent finds from Gmail/HubSpot
- [ ] Embeddings stored and searchable (SELECT * FROM vectors ORDER BY embedding <-> query_vector LIMIT 5)
- [ ] Frontend supports message history
- [ ] Chat endpoint streams LLM responses
