# 🚀 Sprint 4 — Webhooks, Memory, & Proactive Behaviors

**Duration**: 2.5 weeks
**Goal**: Add persistence of rules (“When someone emails me...”), real-time webhooks, and long-running task orchestration.

## ✅ Deliverables

- Webhooks or polling for Gmail, Calendar, HubSpot
- Memory system:
  - Long-term rules (stored in DB)
  - Include in system prompt each time
- Temporal or BullMQ-based long-running task handler
- Proactive agent logic:
  - Example: email received from unknown → create HubSpot contact automatically
  - Example: meeting created → send thank-you email

## 🔧 Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] User can set a rule: “When someone emails me that’s not in HubSpot, create a contact.”
- [ ] When email comes in, system automatically performs action and confirms in chat.
- [ ] Durable tasks continue after waiting for replies (Temporal workflow tested)
- [ ] Webhooks successfully processed from Gmail/HubSpot
